Abstract = {{Polyadenylation signals (PAS) are found in most protein-coding and some
   non-coding genes in eukaryotes. Their accurate recognition improves
   understanding gene regulation mechanisms and recognition of the 3'-end
   of transcribed gene regions where premature or alternate transcription
   ends may lead to various diseases. Although different methods and tools
   for in-silico prediction of genomic signals have been proposed, the
   correct identification of PAS in genomic DNA remains challenging due to
   a vast number of non-relevant hexamers identical to PAS hexamers. In
   this study, we developed a novel method for PAS recognition. The method
   is implemented in a hybrid PAS recognition model (HybPAS), which is
   based on deep neural networks (DNNs) and logistic regression models
   (LRMs). One of such models is developed for each of the 12 most frequent
   human PAS hexamers. DNN models appeared the best for eight PAS types
   (including the two most frequent PAS hexamers), while LRM appeared best
   for the remaining four PAS types. The new models use different
   combinations of signal processing based, statistical, and sequence-based
   features as input. The results obtained on human genomic data show that
   HybPAS outperforms the well-tuned state-of-the-art Omni-PolyA models,
   reducing the classification error for different PAS hexamers by up to
   57.35\% for 10 out of 12 PAS types, with Omni-PolyA models being better
   for two PAS types. For the most frequent PAS types, `AATAAA' and
   `ATTAAA', HybPAS reduced the error rate by 35.14\% and 34.48\%,
   respectively. On average, HybPAS reduces the error by 30.29\%. HybPAS is
   implemented partly in Python and in MATLAB available at
   https://github.com/EMANG-KAUST/PolyA\_PredictionLRM\_DNN.}},

Abstract = {{ALK mutations occur in 10\% of primary neuroblastomas and represent a
   major target for precision treatment. In combination with MYCN
   amplification, ALK mutations infer an ultra-high-risk phenotype
   resulting in very poor patient prognosis. To open up opportunities for
   future precision drugging, a deeper understanding of the molecular
   consequences of constitutive ALK signaling and its relationship to MYCN
   activity in this aggressive pediatric tumor entity will be essential. We
   show that mutant ALK downregulates the `HMG-box transcription factor 1'
   (HBP1) through the PI3K-AKT-FOXO3a signaling axis. HBP1 inhibits both
   the transcriptional activating and repressing activity of MYCN, the
   latter being mediated through PRC2 activity. HBP1 itself is under
   negative control of MYCN through miR-17 similar to 92. Combined
   targeting of HBP1 by PI3K antagonists and MYCN signaling by BET- or
   HDAC-inhibitors blocks MYCN activity and significantly reduces tumor
   growth, suggesting a novel targeted therapy option for high-risk
   neuroblastoma.}},

Journal = {{OXIDATIVE MEDICINE AND CELLULAR LONGEVITY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Abstract = {{In cellular physiology and signaling, reactive oxygen species (ROS) play
   one of the most critical roles. ROS overproduction leads to cellular
   oxidative stress. This may lead to an irrecoverable imbalance of redox
   (oxidation-reduction reaction) function that deregulates redox
   homeostasis, which itself could lead to several diseases including
   neurodegenerative disease, cardiovascular disease, and cancers. In this
   study, we focus on the redox effects related to vascular systems in
   mammals. To support research in this domain, we developed an online
   knowledge base, DES-RedoxVasc, which enables exploration of information
   contained in the biomedical scientific literature. The DES-RedoxVasc
   system analyzed 233399 documents consisting of PubMed abstracts and
   PubMed Central full-text articles related to different aspects of redox
   biology in vascular systems. It allows researchers to explore enriched
   concepts from 28 curated thematic dictionaries, as well as
   literature-derived potential associations of pairs of such enriched
   concepts, where associations themselves are statistically enriched. For
   example, the system allows exploration of associations of pathways,
   diseases, mutations, genes/proteins, miRNAs, long ncRNAs, toxins, drugs,
   biological processes, molecular functions, etc. that allow for insights
   about different aspects of redox effects and control of processes
   related to the vascular system. Moreover, we deliver case studies about
   some existing or possibly novel knowledge regarding redox of vascular
   biology demonstrating the usefulness of DES-RedoxVasc. DES-RedoxVasc is
   the first compiled knowledge base using text mining for the exploration
   of this topic.}},

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{NOV 30}},
Abstract = {{Chemotherapy resistance is responsible for high mortality rates in
   neuroblastoma. MYCN, an oncogenic driver in neuroblastoma, controls
   pluripotency genes including LIN28B. We hypothesized that enhanced
   embryonic stem cell (ESC) gene regulatory programs could mark tumors
   with high pluripotency capacity and subsequently increased risk for
   therapy failure. An ESC miRNA signature was established based on
   publicly available data. In addition, an ESC mRNA signature was
   generated including the 500 protein coding genes with the highest
   positive expression correlation with the ESC miRNA signature score in
   200 neuroblastomas. High ESC m(i)RNA expression signature scores were
   significantly correlated with poor neuroblastoma patient outcome
   specifically in the subgroup of MYCN amplified tumors and stage 4
   nonamplified tumors. Further data-mining identified FOXM1, as the major
   predicted driver of this ESC signature, controlling a large set of genes
   implicated in cell cycle control and DNA damage response. Of further
   interest, re-analysis of published data showed that MYCN
   transcriptionally activates FOXM1 in neuroblastoma cells. In conclusion,
   a novel ESC m(i)RNA signature stratifies neuroblastomas with poor
   prognosis, enabling the identification of therapy-resistant tumors. The
   finding that this signature is strongly FOXM1 driven, warrants for drug
   design targeted at FOXM1 or key components controlling this pathway.}},

Title = {{DES-Mutation: System for Exploring Links of Mutations and Diseases}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{SEP 6}},
Abstract = {{During cellular division DNA replicates and this process is the basis
   for passing genetic information to the next generation. However, the DNA
   copy process sometimes produces a copy that is not perfect, that is, one
   with mutations. The collection of all such mutations in the DNA copy of
   an organism makes it unique and determines the organism's phenotype.
   However, mutations are often the cause of diseases. Thus, it is useful
   to have the capability to explore links between mutations and disease.
   We approached this problem by analyzing a vast amount of published
   information linking mutations to disease states. Based on such
   information, we developed the DES-Mutation knowledgebase which allows
   for exploration of not only mutation-disease links, but also links
   between mutations and concepts from 27 topic-specific dictionaries such
   as human genes/proteins, toxins, pathogens, etc. This allows for a more
   detailed insight into mutation-disease links and context. On a sample of
   600 mutation-disease associations predicted and curated, our system
   achieves precision of 72.83\%. To demonstrate the utility of
   DES-Mutation, we provide case studies related to known or potentially
   novel information involving disease mutations. To our knowledge, this is
   the first mutation-disease knowledgebase dedicated to the exploration of
   this topic through text-mining and data-mining of different mutation
   types and their associations with terms from multiple thematic
   dictionaries.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose Currently, it is unclear to what extent sampling procedures
   affect the epigenome. Here, this phenomenon was evaluated by studying
   the impact of artery ligation on DNA methylation in clear cell renal
   cancer.
   Methods DNA methylation profiles between vascularised tumour biopsy
   samples and devascularised nephrectomy samples from two individuals were
   compared. The relevance of significantly altered methylation profiles
   was validated in an independent clinical trial cohort.
   Results We found that six genes were differentially methylated in the
   test samples, of which four were linked to ischaemia or hypoxia
   (REXO1L1, TLR4, hsa-mir-1299, ANKRD2). Three of these genes were also
   found to be significantly differentially methylated in the validation
   cohort, indicating that the observed effects are genuine.
   Conclusion Tissue ischaemia during normal surgical removal of tumour can
   cause epigenetic changes. Based on these results, we conclude that the
   impact of sampling procedures in clinical epigenetic studies should be
   considered and discussed, particularly after inducing hypoxia/ischaemia,
   which occurs in most oncological surgery procedures through which
   tissues are collected for translational research.}},

Abstract = {{Epigenetic changes can be studied with an untargeted characterization of
   histone post-translational modifications (PTMs) by liquid chromatography
   mass spectrometry (LC-MS). While prior information about more than 20
   types of histone PTMs exists, little is known about histone PTM
   combinations (PTMCs). Because of the combinatorial explosion it is
   intrinsically impossible to consider all potential PTMCs in a database
   search. Consequentially, high-scoring false positives with unconsidered
   but correct alternative isobaric PTMCs can occur. Current quality
   controls can neither estimate the amount of unconsidered alternatives
   nor flag potential false positives. Here, we propose a conceptual
   workflow that provides such options. In this workflow, an in silico
   modeling of all candidate isoforms with known-to-exist PTMs is made. The
   most frequently occurring PTM sets of these candidate isoforms are
   determined and used in several database searches. This suppresses the
   combinatorial explosion while considering as many candidate isoforms as
   possible. Finally, annotations can be classified as unique or ambiguous,
   the latter implying false positives. This workflow was evaluated on an
   LC-MS data set containing 44 histone extracts. We were able to consider
   60\% of all candidate isoforms. Importantly, 40\% of all annotations
   were classified as ambiguous. This highlights the need for a more
   thorough evaluation of modified peptide annotations.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Genetic intratumoral heterogeneity (ITH) hinders biomarker
   development in metastatic clear cell renal cancer (mccRCC). Epigenetic
   relative to genetic ITH or the presence of consistent epigenetic changes
   following targeted therapy in mccRCC have not been evaluated. The aim of
   this study was to determine methylome/genetic ITH and to evaluate
   specific epigenetic and genetic changes associated with sunitinib
   therapy.
   Patients and methods: Multi-region DNA sampling performed on sequential
   frozen pairs of primary tumor tissue from 14 metastatic ccRCC patients,
   in the Upfront Sunitinib (SU011248) Therapy Followed by Surgery in
   Patients with Metastatic Renal Cancer: a Pilot Phase II Study (SuMR;
   ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01024205), at presentation (biopsy)
   and after 3-cycles of 50mg sunitinib (nephrectomy). Untreated biopsy and
   nephrectomy samples before and after renal artery ligation were
   controls. Ion Proton sequencing of 48 key ccRCC genes, and MethylCap-seq
   DNA methylation analysis was performed, data was analysed using the
   statistical computing environment R.
   Results: Unsupervised hierarchical clustering revealed complete
   methylome clustering of biopsy and three nephrectomy samples for each
   patient (14/14 patients). For mutational status, untreated biopsy and
   all treated nephrectomy samples clustered together in 8/13 (61.5\%)
   patients. The only methylation target significantly altered following
   sunitinib therapy was VHL promoter region 7896829 which was
   hypermethylated with treatment (FDR=0.077, P<0.001) and consistent for
   all patients (pre-treatment 50\% patients had VHL mutations, 14\%
   patients VHL hypermethylation). Renal artery ligation did not affect
   this result. No significant differences in driver or private mutation
   count was found with sunitinib treatment.
   Conclusions: Demonstration of relative methylome homogeneity and
   consistent VHL hypermethylation, after sunitinib, may overcome the
   hurdle of ITH present at other molecular levels for biomarker research.}},

Abstract = {{The DNA Commission of the International Society for Forensic Genetics
   (ISFG) is reviewing factors that need to be considered ahead of the
   adoption by the forensic community of short tandem repeat (STR)
   genotyping by massively parallel sequencing (MPS) technologies. MPS
   produces sequence data that provide a precise description of the repeat
   allele structure of a STR marker and variants that may reside in the
   flanking areas of the repeat region. When a STR contains a complex
   arrangement of repeat motifs, the level of genetic polymorphism revealed
   by the sequence data can increase substantially. As repeat structures
   can be complex and include substitutions, insertions, deletions,
   variable tandem repeat arrangements of multiple nucleotide motifs, and
   flanking region SNPs, established capillary electrophoresis (CE) allele
   descriptions must be supplemented by a new system of STR allele
   nomenclature, which retains backward compatibility with the CE data that
   currently populate national DNA databases and that will continue to be
   produced for the coming years. Thus, there is a pressing need to produce
   a standardized framework for describing complex sequences that enable
   comparison with currently used repeat allele nomenclature derived from
   conventional CE systems. It is important to discern three levels of
   information in hierarchical order (i) the sequence, (ii) the alignment,
   and (iii) the nomenclature of STR sequence data. We propose a sequence
   (text) string format the minimal requirement of data storage that
   laboratories should follow when adopting MPS of STRs. We further discuss
   the variant annotation and sequence comparison framework necessary to
   maintain compatibility among established and future data. This system
   must be easy to use and interpret by the DNA specialist, based on a
   universally accessible genome assembly, and in place before the uptake
   of MPS by the general forensic community starts to generate sequence
   data on a large scale. While the established nomenclature for CE-based
   STR analysis will remain unchanged in the future, the nomenclature of
   sequence-based STR genotypes will need to follow updated rules and be
   generated by expert systems that translate MPS sequences to match CE
   conventions in order to guarantee compatibility between the different
   generations of STR data. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Effect of multiple allelic drop-outs in forensic RMNE calculations}},
Journal = {{FORENSIC SCIENCE INTERNATIONAL-GENETICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{19}},
Pages = {{243-249}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Technological advances such as massively parallel sequencing enable
   increasing amounts of genetic information to be obtained from
   increasingly challenging samples. Certainly on low template, degraded
   and multi-contributor samples, drop-outs will increase in number for
   many profiles simply by analyzing more loci, making it difficult to
   probabilistically assess how many drop-outs have occurred and at which
   loci they might have occurred. Previously we developed a Random Man Not
   Excluded (RMNE) method that can take into account allelic drop-out while
   avoiding detailed estimations of the probability that drop-outs have
   occurred, nor making assumptions about at which loci these drop-outs
   might have occurred. The number of alleles that have dropped out, does
   not need to be exactly known. Here we report a generic Python algorithm
   to calculate the RMNE probabilities for any given number of loci. The
   number of allowed drop-outs can be set between 0 and twice the number of
   analyzed loci. The source code has been made available on
   https://github.com/fvnieuwe/rmne. An online web-based RMNE calculation
   tool has been made available on http://forensic.ugent.be/rmne. The tool
   can calculate these RMNE probabilities from a custom list of
   probabilities of the observed and non-observed alleles from any given
   number of loci. Using this tool, we explored the effect of allowing
   allelic drop-outs on the evidential value of random forensic profiles
   with a varying number of loci. Our results give insight into how the
   number of allowed drop-outs affects the evidential value of a profile
   and how drop-out can be managed in the RMNE approach. (C) 2015 The

   while in the latter, data from forensic samples that are sequenced on an
   Illumina sequencer can be uploaded to Basespace during acquisition, and
   can subsequently be analyzed using the published MyFLq BaseSpace
   application. Additional features were implemented such as an interactive
   graphical report of the results, an interactive threshold selection bar,
   and an allele length-based analysis in addition to the sequenced-based
   analysis.
   Practical use of the application is demonstrated through the analysis of

   internal gene expression regulation and in antiviral defense. We
   discovered a NR in the female C crangon which is either a very rapidly
   evolved homolog of HR10, or a novel NR altogether. This new NR could act
   as a biological marker for sex determination as it is not expressed in
   male adults. Most RNAi-related genes were present in C crangon, proving
   that the requirements for successful RNAi is present in this decapod

Journal = {{FORENSIC SCIENCE INTERNATIONAL-GENETICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Pages = {{1-8}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Forensic scientists are currently investigating how to transition from
   capillary electrophoresis (CE) to massive parallel sequencing (MPS) for
   analysis of forensic DNA profiles. MPS offers several advantages over CE
   such as virtually unlimited multiplexy of loci, combining both short
   tandem repeat (STR) and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) loci, small
   amplicons without constraints of size separation, more discrimination
   power, deep mixture resolution and sample multiplexing. We present our
   bioinformatic framework My-Forensic-Loci-queries (MyFLq) for analysis of
   MPS forensic data. For allele calling, the framework uses a MySQL
   reference allele database with automatically determined regions of
   interest (ROIs) by a generic maximal flanking algorithm which makes it
   possible to use any STR or SNP forensic locus. Python scripts were
   designed to automatically make allele calls starting from raw MPS data.
   We also present a method to assess the usefulness and overall
   performance of a forensic locus with respect to MPS, as well as methods
   to estimate whether an unknown allele, which sequence is not present in
   the MySQL database, is in fact a new allele or a sequencing error. The
   MyFLq framework was applied to an Illumina MiSeq dataset of a forensic
   Illumina amplicon library, generated from multilocus STR polymerase
   chain reaction (PCR) on both single contributor samples and multiple
   person DNA mixtures. Although the multilocus PCR was not yet optimized
   for MPS in terms of amplicon length or locus selection, the results show
   excellent results for most loci. The results show a high signal-to-noise
   ratio, correct allele calls, and a low limit of detection for minor DNA
   contributors in mixed DNA samples. Technically, forensic MPS affords
   great promise for routine implementation in forensic genomics. The
   method is also applicable to adjacent disciplines such as mitochondrial
   DNA research. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Title = {{Differential transcriptome analysis of glandular and filamentous
   trichomes in Artemisia annua}},
Journal = {{BMC PLANT BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{13}},
Month = {{DEC 20}},
Abstract = {{Background: The medicinal plant Artemisia annua is covered with
   filamentous trichomes and glandular, artemisinin producing trichomes. A
   high artemisinin supply is needed at a reduced cost for treating
   malaria. Artemisinin production in bioreactors can be facilitated if a
   better insight is obtained in the biosynthesis of artemisinin and other
   metabolites. Therefore, metabolic activities of glandular and
   filamentous trichomes were investigated at the transcriptome level.
   Results: By laser pressure catapulting, glandular and filamentous
   trichomes as well as apical and sub-apical cells from glandular
   trichomes were collected and their transcriptome was sequenced using
   Illumina RNA-Seq. A de novo transcriptome was assembled (Trinity) and
   studied with a differential expression analysis (edgeR).
   A comparison of the transcriptome from glandular and filamentous
   trichomes shows that MEP, MVA, most terpene and lipid biosynthesis
   pathways are significantly upregulated in glandular trichomes.
   Conversely, some transcripts coding for specific sesquiterpenoid and
   triterpenoid enzymes such as 8-epi-cedrol synthase and an
   uncharacterized oxidosqualene cyclase were significantly upregulated in
   filamentous trichomes. All known artemisinin biosynthesis genes are
   upregulated in glandular trichomes and were detected in both the apical
   and sub-apical cells of the glandular trichomes. No significant
   differential expression could be observed between the apical and
   sub-apical cells.
   Conclusions: Our results underscore the vast metabolic capacities of A.
   annua glandular trichomes but nonetheless point to the existence of
   specific terpene metabolic pathways in the filamentous trichomes.
   Candidate genes that might be involved in artemisinin biosynthesis are
   proposed based on their putative function and their differential
   expression level.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To investigate how biologically relevant markers change in
   response to antiangiogenic therapy in metastatic clear cell renal cancer
   (mRCC) and correlate these changes with outcome.
   Experimental Design: The study used sequential tumor tissue and
   functional imaging (taken at baseline and 12-16 weeks) obtained from
   three similar phase II studies. All three studies investigated the role
   of VEGF tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) before planned nephrectomy in
   untreated mRCC (n = 85). The effect of targeted therapy on ten
   biomarkers was measured from sequential tissue. Comparative genomic
   hybridization (CGH) array and DNA methylation profiling (MethylCap-seq)
   was performed in matched frozen pairs. Biomarker expression was
   correlated with early progression (progression as best response) and
   delayed progression (between 12-16 weeks).
   Results: VEGF TKI treatment caused a significant reduction in vessel
   density (CD31), phospho-S6K expression, PDL-1 expression, and FOXP3
   expression (P < 0.05 for each). It also caused a significant increase in
   cytoplasmic FGF-2, MET receptor expression in vessels, Fuhrman tumor
   grade, and Ki-67 (P < 0.05 for each). Higher levels of Ki-67 and CD31
   were associated with delayed progression (P < 0.05). Multiple samples (n
   = 5) from the same tumor showed marked heterogeneity of tumor grade,
   which increased significantly with treatment. Array CGH showed extensive
   intrapatient variability, which did not occur in DNA methylation
   analysis.
   Conclusion: TKI treatment is associated with dynamic changes in relevant
   biomarkers, despite significant heterogeneity in chromosomal and
   protein, but not epigenetic expression. Changes to Ki-67 expression and
   tumor grade indicate that treatment is associated with an increase in
   the aggressive phenotype of the tumor. (C)2013 AACR.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to screen a dog population from Belgium,
   the Netherlands and Germany for the presence of mutant alleles
   associated with hip dysplasia (HD), degenerative myelopathy (DM),
   exercise-induced collapse (EIC), neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis 4A
   (NCL), centronuclear myopathy (HMLR), mucopolysaccharidosis VII (MPS
   VII), myotonia congenita (MG), gangliosidosis (GM1) and muscular
   dystrophy (Duchenne type) (GRMD). Blood samples (K3EDTA) were collected
   for genotyping with Kompetitive Allele Specific PCR (n = 476). Allele
   and genotype frequencies were calculated in those breeds with at least
   12 samples (n = 8). Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was tested. Genetic
   variation was identified for 4 out of 9 disorders: mutant alleles were
   found in 49, 15, 3 and 2 breeds for HD, DM, EIC and NCL respectively.
   Additionally, mutant alleles were identified in crossbreeds for both HD
   and EIC. For HD, DM, EIC and NCL mutant alleles were newly discovered in
   43, 13, 2 and 1 breed(s), respectively. In 9, 2 and 1 breed(s) for DM,
   EIC and NCL respectively, the mutant allele was detected, but the
   respective disorder has not been reported in those breeds. For 5
   disorders (HMLR, MPS VII, MG, GM1, GRMD), the mutant allele could not be
   identified in our population. For the other 4 disorders (HD, DM, EIC,
   NCL), prevalence of associated mutant alleles seems strongly breed
   dependent. Surprisingly, mutant alleles were found in many breeds where
   the disorder has not been reported to date.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Selecting stably expressed reference genes is essential for
   proper reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction gene
   expression analysis. However, this choice is not always straightforward.
   In the case of differentiating human embryonic stem (hES) cells,
   differentiation itself introduces changes whereby reference gene
   stability may be influenced.
   Results: In this study, we evaluated the stability of various references
   during retinoic acid-induced (2 microM) differentiation of hES cells.
   Out of 12 candidate references, beta-2-microglobulin, ribosomal protein
   L13A and Alu repeats are found to be the most stable for this
   experimental set-up.
   Conclusions: Our results show that some of the commonly used reference
   genes are actually not amongst the most stable loci during hES cell
   differentiation promoted by retinoic acid. Moreover, a novel
   normalization strategy based on expressed Alu repeats is validated for
   use in hES cell experiments.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{We explore the applicability of second generation sequencing (SGS) to
   sequence multiplexed forensic STR amplicons, both in a single
   contributor sample as in multiple-person mixtures with different ratios.
   We compare the results of a commercial STR profiling kit (Applied
   Biosystems AmpFlSTR (R) Profiler Plus (R)), analyzed both with capillary
   electrophoresis and with Roche GS FLX sequencing. An easy to use
   open-source software pipeline is provided, chaining together the
   different steps needed to start the analysis from a GS FLX FASTA file,
   resulting in a FASTA file containing the called and quantified alleles
   present in the data. Sequencing of multiplexed STR amplicons using Roche
   GS FLX titanium technology is technically feasible but the technology is
   not ideal for this purpose. The fraction of full length reads is small
   and the homopolymer sequencing error rate is high. The pipeline
   compresses the homopolymers to a single base to avoid false results
   caused by these homopolymers. The qualitative and quantitative results
   from the SGS STR analysis pipeline are comparable to the electrophoresis
   method. Additionally, the SGS method provides extra information and is
   able to call allele subtypes based on STR sequences in a database. In
   mixed samples, all alleles were reported from individuals that
   contributed at least 10\% to the mixture. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
